# Plagiarism Type Identifier using NLP

This project identifies and classifies plagiarism types in text documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) for classification
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Easy-to-use modular code structure

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plagiarism-Type-Identifier-NLP.git
cd Plagiarism-Type-Identifier-NLP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Models Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset
The dataset contains text pairs labeled with plagiarism types. Due to licensing restrictions, it is not included here. Replace `dataset.csv` with your own.

## Future Scope
- Implement deep learning approaches like LSTM/BERT
- Create a web interface for easier access
- Expand dataset to cover more languages
